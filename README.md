# vis-proust

**Marcel Proust** wrote **"Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu"** (In Search of the Lost Time) between 1906 and 1922. It is considered to be a master-piece of the French Litterature. The text spans over seven volumes, over 1000000 words, and thousands of pages. Being an admirer of the book, I decided do some statistics around its structure and content using Python for the data processing and **Observable** for the presentation of the results.

Available in this repository:
- Python Map / Reduce code to do the extraction of text features
- Python code relying on pandas to do the data crunching
- A few tests written with Pytest
- The source CSV data and the refined CSV files feeding the notebook

# vis-proust

**Marcel Proust** wrote **"Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu"** ("In Search of the Lost Time") between 1906 and 1922. It is considered to be one of the master-pieces of the French Litterature. The text spans over seven volumes and thousands of pages. Being an admirer of the book, I decided do some statistics around its structure and content using **Python** for the data processing and **Observable** for the presentation of the results.

Available in this repository:
- Python Map / Reduce code to do the extraction of text features
- Python code relying on pandas to do the data crunching
- Package functions tests written with Pytest
- The source CSV data and the refined CSV files feeding the notebook
